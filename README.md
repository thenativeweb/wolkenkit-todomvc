## Installation

To run a wolkenkit application, you first need to install wolkenkit. For this, see the installation guide for [macOS](https://docs.wolkenkit.io/latest/getting-started/installing-wolkenkit/installing-on-macos/), [Linux](https://docs.wolkenkit.io/latest/getting-started/installing-wolkenkit/installing-on-linux/), [Windows](https://docs.wolkenkit.io/latest/getting-started/installing-wolkenkit/installing-on-windows/), or [Docker Machine](https://docs.wolkenkit.io/latest/getting-started/installing-wolkenkit/installing-using-docker-machine/).

Additionally, you need a web server to run the client application, such as [http-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server). For that, use the following command:

```shell
$ npm install -g http-server
```

## Quick start

First you need to start the TodoMVC wolkenkit application. Change to the directory where you have installed the application to, and run the following command:

```shell
$ wolkenkit start
```

Once you get the message that the wolkenkit application is running, run the web server using the following command:

```shell
$ http-server ./client -o
```

Additionally, this will open a browser automatically and direct it to the client.
